### About this blog

Welcome to my personal blog, where I share my experiences mostly on technical stuff: software development, devops, home automation. The goal of this blog is mainly to serve as a notebook so I can come back to it later if I need to. But that would be fantastic if these articles can help others! If you think there's something I have missed in one of my articles, please drop me a message - it will be highly appreciated!

### About me

My name is Anthony Hocquet. I am full stack software engineer, working mainly with ASP.NET and Azure. I'm passionate about coding, devops and home automation; I do my best to design testable, scalable solutions. I am continuously trying to improve myself through reading and experimenting new approaches in software design.
